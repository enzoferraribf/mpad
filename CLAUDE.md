# What is this project

This project is a collaborative markdown editor with previews. There's no authentication, all communication
happens through a WebRTC server. Data like document state is persisted in a Database, so when all WebRTC
connections drop, we still can see the document later.

It uses NextJS with React for everything. It uses Tailwind CSS + ShadCN to style things.

## What not to do

Every time I give you an instruction, please only work on the minimum necessary to achieve what I need.
Do not edit random files out of "oh, it would be nice" - stick to the job.

## What you should do

You are versed in React good practices and also NextJS. You should always write idiomatic React, and make
the code as clean as possible - that means without comments! Your variable names should be descriptive, as
well as your functions and so on.

You should also attain to the project style, architecture and general guidelines.
